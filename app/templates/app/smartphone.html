        <p> You might want to use the voices on your mobile applications, browser, or desktop. With <a
                href="http://cmuflite.org/" target="_blank">Flite</a>, a
            TTS engine
            built at CMU, this is possible.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-primary"> Android </h2>
        <p> The first step is to install Flite TTS from Google Playstore</p>

        After installing this application, you will have to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Enable Flite from "Text to Speech Settings" on your phone
            </li>
            <li>Install voice data</li>
            <li>Go to "Language" settings and select the voice that you want.</li>
            <li>By clicking on "Listen to a sample" you can verify that Flite is working.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="h2-primary"> iOS</h2>
        We do not have an iOS version of flite yet. It is coming soon.
